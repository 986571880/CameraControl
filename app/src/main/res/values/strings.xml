    <string name="summary_blockAccess">Block access to this camera when the app attempts to open it.
        An app will usually not try to access cameras it does not know about, so hiding a camera should be enough.
        You can still use this for additional security, but it\'s not recommended to block access without hiding the cameras.</string>
